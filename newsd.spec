%description
Newsd is a standalone local NNTP news server for private
newsgroup serving on a single server.  It is useful for serving
private newsgroup(s) to an intranet or the Internet and can act
as a simple mail gateway, however it does not interface with
other news servers and cannot manage distributed news feeds,
i.e. Usenet news.
